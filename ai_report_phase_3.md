# PHASE 3 AI-USAGE REPORT

The concepts were researched and understood using lecture slides as well as online videos with AI assistance.


## Notebook Structure

### 1. Getting EXIF Data
- EXIF format was entirely new, so we took GPT support and directed what to look for in this.  
- All relevant information could be received from phone image settings as well, but we thought it would be better to display it in the notebook and keep values as variables.


## Phase 2
- We repeated Phase 2 as this time we used a different camera with different specifications.  
- We also wanted to improve on the already done Phase 2 component.  
- Phase 2 serves as a setup for the incremental phase and requires proper saving of variables, which was done by AI.  
- The rest was repeated as is from Phase 2 with changes in intrinsic value calculation to improve.  
- The formulae for correct calculation were given and done by AI.


## Incremental Phase
- Tried and tested lots of code, most wasn’t working.  
- Used AI to make sure code is error-free.  
- Repeated most code every increment so that no working code is changed.  
- The classes and usage are AI-generated, but how to implement the classes as well as use them is directed.  
- All library usages with unknown functionalities were assisted by AI, as we are not yet accustomed to them.
